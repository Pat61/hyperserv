DESIGN  |___/|_| 
======
HyperServ is a Sauerbraten server which accepts python plugins to extend the functionality.
HyperServ features a cubescript interpreter at its core, and all the functions are exposed to the cubescript system.
Then cubescript can be used from various places including IRC, ingame, console, http. This provides uniform functionality and no disadvantage in using one interface for the other.

HISTORY
=======
HyperServ was created by SirAlex because he wanted something like XSBS extensibility but with frogmod functionality.
He decided upon XSBS but the issue was that it was kind of hard to implement the features that he wanted(editing, consistent irc control) on the already finished foundation.
He eventually forked XSBS(from commit: 41b8a5d293376a91f76a1dd14dbd5bb58e10c27b) for its C++ fondation and started the python from scratch. Thanks are in need to greghayes, darkf and others for their work so far on XSBS.

PREREQUISITES
=============
Before you can build and install the server, you must have the following installed on your computer.
